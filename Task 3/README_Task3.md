# Task 3: Heart Disease Prediction

## Objective
Build a model to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on their health data.

## Dataset
Heart Disease UCI Dataset (available on Kaggle)

## Instructions
- Clean the data set (handle missing values if any)
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends
- Train a classification model (Logistic Regression or Decision Tree)
- Evaluate using metrics: accuracy, ROC curve, and confusion matrix
- Highlight important features affecting prediction

## Skills Practiced
- Binary classification
- Medical data understanding and interpretation
- Model evaluation using ROC-AUC and confusion matrix
- Feature importance analysis

## How to Run
1. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
2. Open the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Task3_HeartDisease_Merged.ipynb
```

## Output
The notebook includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory visualizations
- Model training and evaluation
- ROC curve and confusion matrix
- Feature importance ranking
